<h2>🎮 Simon Says</h2>

    A simple memory-based game where the player must repeat an ever-growing sequence of signals.

<h2>🛠️ Setup </h2>

    Create source files for HTML/CSS/JS (or your chosen language).
    Add interactive components: Start button, visual pads (e.g. 4 colored buttons), status display.

<h2>🚀 Game Flow </h2>

  ◆ Start Game 

    Player clicks Start → interface resets → computer begins the sequence.

  ◆ Computer Turn

    Randomly select and display a new step (e.g. flash a pad + play tone).
    Append it to the computer’s sequence array.

  ◆ Player Turn

    Player repeats the sequence by clicking pads.
    After each click, check if input matches the corresponding computer value.

  ◆ Validation

    If a mismatch: show a failure message and reset.
    If correct and sequence is complete: proceed to next round.
    Optionally, win the game after reaching a defined maximum length (e.g. 20 rounds).

<h2>🎯 UI  </h2>

    Show current level or round.
    Disable clicks during the computer’s turn.
    Update status messages.
